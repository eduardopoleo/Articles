Here's a collections of things that I find myself sometimes looking over and over again through the web. I decided to gather them in order to avoid future pain.  

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Flash messages</i></h3>
A simple way to implement a fairly good looking flash messages with bootstrap 3 in rails.

```ruby
#application_helper.rb
module ApplicationHelper
  def bootstrap_class_for(flash_type)
    case flash_type
      when "success"
        "success"   # Green
      when "error"
        "danger"    # Red
      when "alert"
        "warning"   # Yellow
      when "notice"
        "info"      # Blue
      else
        flash_type.to_s
    end
  end
end

#views/shared/_flash.html.haml
- flash.each do |type, message|
  .container
    %div{:class => "alert alert-#{bootstrap_class_for(type)} fade in"}
      %button.close{"data-dismiss" => "alert"} Ã—
      = message
      
views/layouts/application.html.haml
%html
  %head
    %title Firecamp
    = csrf_meta_tags
    = stylesheet_link_tag    'application'
    = javascript_include_tag 'application'
    = yield :head 
  %body
    =  render 'shared/navbar'
    =  render 'shared/flash'
    = yield
```
<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Assests not showing up in production</i></h3>
Sometimes my assets are not properly displayed in heroku's server. This apparently is a fairly common problem but with many different causes. The following recipe has consistently worked for me.

```ruby
#production.rb
config.assets.compile = true
config.assets.precompile =  ['*.js', '*.css', '*.css.erb'] 

#console
rake assets:precompile
```

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Testing miscellaneous in Rspec </i></h3>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">1. </span>Common expectations</h4>
It is unlikely that I will forget these as I use them all the time, but still thought it was worth mentioning them.

```ruby
eq
be_new_record
be_instace_of
render_template
redirect_to
be_present
be_a_new
match_array #matches the array without considering the order
be_truthy
```

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">2.</span> Test to redirect :back</h4>
Tests the <code>redirect_to :back</code> response.
```ruby
  #We set up the fake host and then test the response to it
  request.env["HTTP_REFERER"] = "http://fake.host"
  expect(response).to redirect_to "http://fake.host"
```

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">3.</span> Test mail delivery</h4>
Testing mail deliveries:

```ruby
  it 'sends and email to a friend' do
    post :create, invitation: {guest_name: 'Joe', guest_email: 'joe@example.com', invitation_message: 'Hey come and join me at Myflix'}
    expect(ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.last.to).to eq(["joe@example.com"])
  end
  
  #To make sure that the we erase all the mails in the test environment
  after do
    ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.clear
  end
```
<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">4.</span>Raising errors</h4>
This is an odd case that requires using { } instead of the regular ().
```ruby
it 'raises an exception when the string contains a negative number' do
  expect{StringCalculator.add("//:4:-145677")}.to raise_error(RuntimeError,'You have negative numbers')
end
```

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Useful one-liners</i></h3>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">1.</span> Deleting ghost records</h4>
Sometimes we want to prevent unsaved records from being added to an array of records. A good example of this is the typical blog application where we the comments form is the same view where all the comments are listed, which corresponds to the article show page (e.g [Getting started blog](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html "blog"	). What happens is that if the new comment fails validation we will have an undesired empty comment showing up on the view when it gets rendered.  

To avoid this when can use a very useful one liner.

```ruby
class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
    @comment = @article.comments.build(comment_params)
    if @commment.save
      redirect_to article_path(@article)
    else
      #this is the magical one liner
      @comments = @article.comments.to_a.delete_if(&:new_record?)
      render 'article/show'
    end
  end
end
```
Note how we need to transform the collection into an array using the ```.to_a``` method, this is because the ```ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy``` does not have many iterative methods such as ```delete_if```. 

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">2.</span> Multiple associated records.</h4>
It is also very common that we need to set up several associations when saving a record which would be a pain if we had to do each of them on a different line. The same blog example applies when we want to save a comment and we need to associate it with an article and a user.

```ruby
class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @article = Article.find(params[:article_id])
    #pain
    @comment = Comment.new(comment_params)
    @comment.article = @article
    @comment.user = current_user
    ###
    if @commment.save
      redirect_to article_path(@article)
    else
      @comments = @article.comments.to_a.delete_if(&:new_record?)
      render 'article/show'
    end
  end
end
```

We can reduce this by:

```ruby
@comment = @article.comments.build(comment_params.merge!(user: current_user)) 
```
And this have the exact same effect as the 3 lines above.
