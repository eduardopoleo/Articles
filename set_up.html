<p>Every once in a while I start a fresh new project and it takes me a while to get everything up and running. Not because it is extremely difficult but because I usually have to google a great deal of the set up process. Therefore ... this post!</p>

<p>I am going to skip the user/role creation for postgresql. I am still not very sure what the steps for a proper set up are, although <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9987171/rails-3-2-fatal-peer-authentication-failed-for-user-pgerror">this</a> stackoverflow question it's been helpful for me in the past.</p>

<p>Anyhow once the user creation is out of the way we can proceed to create our new app: </p>
```python
rails new myapp --database=postgresql
```

<p>Then we can configure the data base by modifying the <code>database.yml</code> file.</p>

```ruby
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: myapp_development
  pool: 5
  username: myapp
  password: password1

test:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: myapp_test
  pool: 5
  username: myapp
  password: password1
```

<p>We can then create the databases:</p>

```python
rake db:create db:migrate
```

<p>At this point we should run the server to verify that everything is working fine:</p>

```ruby
rails s
```

<p>Now we can proceed to set up the right gems. For a project that includes testing this is a good set up</p>

```ruby
#gemfile.rb
source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby '2.1.1'

gem 'bootstrap-sass'
gem 'coffee-rails'
gem 'rails', '4.1.1'
gem 'haml-rails'
gem 'sass-rails'
gem 'uglifier'
gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'pg'
gem 'bcrypt'
gem 'bootstrap_form'
gem 'fabrication'
gem 'faker'
gem 'turbolinks'
#gem 'rename' if you want to create a blank slate for all your projects

group :development do
  gem 'thin'
  gem "better_errors"
  gem "binding_of_caller"
end

group :development, :test do
  gem 'pry'
  gem 'pry-nav'
  gem 'rspec-rails', '2.99'
end

group :test do
  gem 'database_cleaner', '1.2.0'
  gem 'shoulda-matchers'
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'launchy'
end

group :production do
  gem 'rails_12factor'
end
```

<p>After which we should run <code>bundle update</code>.</p>
<p>We can now set up the bootstrap. We start by changing the application.css file to include the scss extension.</p>

```python
application.css.scss
```


<p>Now we import the Bootstrap styles by adding this to the application.css.scss file</p>

Edit: This configuration is not the one recommended but it allows me to place my code in multiple stylesheets

```ruby
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
 *= require rails_bootstrap_forms
 */

@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";
```

<p>it is important to REMOVE all the <code>//= require</code> from the file, as specified in the bootstrap saas <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Then we should require Bootstrap Javascript.</p>

```ruby
#application.js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require bootstrap-sprockets
//= require_tree .
```

<p>In order to verify that everything is working properly we can just set a route to something like this:</p>

```ruby
root 'welcome#index'
```

 <p>And after creating the corresponding <code>welcome_controller.rb</code> we can paste the following code on the index.html.haml just to check that everything is in place </p>

```python
%nav.navbar.navbar-inverse.navbar-fixed-top{:role => "navigation"}
  .container
    .navbar-header
      %button.navbar-toggle{"data-target" => "#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1", "data-toggle" => "collapse", :type => "button"}
        %span.sr-only Toggle navigation
        %span.icon-bar
        %span.icon-bar
        %span.icon-bar
      %a.navbar-brand{:href => "#"} Start Bootstrap
    #bs-example-navbar-collapse-1.collapse.navbar-collapse
      %ul.nav.navbar-nav
        %li
          %a{:href => "#"} About
        %li
          %a{:href => "#"} Services
        %li
          %a{:href => "#"} Contact
```

Edit: I am editing this article to also include Rspec configuration

Since the rspec gem is already configured we can just run the following in out terminal window:

```ruby
rails g rspec:install
```

That's all we need to start writing specs. Now if we also want to set up capybara we need to add:

```ruby
#spec_helper
require 'capybara/rails'
```

We could create a blank_template repo in github to avoid doing this from scratch every time. Next time you need to start a new project all you have to do is:

<ul>
  <li>Clone your repo into your directory</li>
  <li>bundle install</li>
  <li>rename your app if you wish <code>rails g rename:app_to new_app_name</code></li>
  <li>change the data base names accordingly</li>
  <li>run <code>rake db:create db:migrate</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And that's it we are ready to go</p>
