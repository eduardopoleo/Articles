<p>When we have several possible scenarios we can define <code>contexts</code> in order to create more comprehensive test code.</p>

<p>Let's assume that we are developing a video streaming application and we want to allow the users to write reviews for the videos. We already created the respective models associations and templates but we still have to write up some code for the reviews_controller, specifically the create actions</p>

<p>Since only the logged in users are allowed to write reviews we will have a fairly amount of possible cases to consider, which sets a perfect scenario for the use of contexts.</p>

<p>So we can divide the create action spec as follows:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code>#spec/controllers/reviews_controller_spec.rb
require 'spec_helper'
describe ReviewsController do
  describe 'POST create' do

    context 'authenticated user' do
      context 'valid inputs' do
        it 'creates review'
        it 'creates a review associated with the video'
        it 'creates a review associated with the user'
        it 'redirects_to video show page'
      end

      context 'invalid inputs' do
        it 'does NOT create the review'
        it 'renders show video path'
        it 'sets the variable @video'
        it 'sets the variables @ reviews'
      end
    end

    context 'unauthenticated user' do
      it redirects to the signin path
    end
  end
end</code>
</pre>

<p>We are now set out to write our test code. The code for the 'creates review' could look like this:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code>it 'creates review' do
  # Setting the video
  video = Fabricate(:video)
  # Issuing the request
  post :create, review: Fabricate.attributes_for(:review), video_id: video.id
  expect(Review.count).to eq(1)
  post
end</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that we need to pass in the <code>video_id </code>due to the 1:M model association </p>
