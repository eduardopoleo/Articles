the syntax required to set up a regular many to many assotiatios is the following

If a post has many categories

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code>Class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :post_categories
  has_many :categories, through: :post_categories
end

Class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :post_categories
  has_many :categories, through: :post_categories
end

Class PostCategory < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :post
  belongs_to :category
end</code>
</pre>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code>post_categories
id --> integer
caterory_id --> integer
post_id --> integer

categories
id --> integer
name --> string

post 
id --> integer
title --> string
content --> text</code>
</pre>

There is an slightly modified version of this type of relationship that has an 

friends on facebook


<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code>class User
  has_many :friendships
  has_many :friends, through: friendships  
end

class Friendship
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :friend, :class_name => "User"
end</code>
</pre>


So we only need to models because there is not such a thing as a friend model because all friends are users!

Although there is not friend model the schema for the friendship model will look like this:

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code>friendship
user_id --> integer
friend_id --> integer </code>
</pre>

The controller code for the frienship will look like this:


<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code>class FrienshipsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @friendship = current_user.friendships.build(friend_id: params[:friend_id])
    if @friendship.save
      flash[:notice] = "Your friend request have been successfully sent"
      redirect_to user_path(current_user) 
    else
      flash[:error] = "Your friend request could not be sent"
      redirect_to user_path(current_user) 
    end

  def destroy
    @friendship = current_user.friendships.find(params[:id])
    @friendship.destroy
    flash[:notice] = "You have succesfully unfriend someone"
    redirect_to user_path(current_user)
  end
end</code>
</pre>

When trying to destroy these type of relationships we just need to target the join model, in this case the friendship.
We can also access the apointments or the friends or whatever by referencing the join model itself. 
when looping through our friends we may be tempted to do something like this

current_user.friends.each |friend|
  friend.name
end

this is limiting because although we defitely are going to get the desire result we will not be able to modify the corresponding join assotiatios

link_to "Remove friend", post: delete .. etc wont work because we are not trying to delete the user we are trying to destroy the "friendship"

So it is better if we loop through the information stored in the friendship model. This will allow us to make modification to the join model, in this case friendship.

@user.friendships.each do |friendship|
  friendship.friend.name
end

This allows us to for instance remove friendships by

link_to remove, friendship, method: 'delete'


So far we are only able to see friends that we have added but our list wont contain those friends that have added us. We c

I can only see friends through frienships where I am the user_id and my friend is on the friend_id. Not the other way around. so

we can add the following code to our application
Why can't I just do something like this friendships.where(friend_id: current_user.id)

@friendships.each do |friendship|
  frienship.user.name
end


has_many :reverse_friendships, class_name: "Friendship", :foreign_key => "friend_id"
has_many :reverse_friends, through: invers_friendships, :source => :user

The class_name is added because reverse frienships are stills friendships but only the ones that we would not normaly see and we also have to tell rails which
foreign key it will use.
