<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Mailgun</i></h3>

In one of my <a href="http://eduardo-blog.herokuapp.com/articles/27" target="_blank">previous articles</a> I showed how to set up rails mailers from a personal gmail account. This might me ok for a small personal app but if we are expecting a larger traffic or we want to make sure that our emails get delivered, it's best to load this off to a specialized third party vendor such as <a href="http://www.mailgun.com/" target="_blank">mailgun</a>.

Setting up mailgun in heroku is easy we just need to install their <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/mailgun?utm_campaign=search&utm_medium=dashboard&utm_source=addons" target="_blank">mailgun addon</a> and then add the following <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mailgun#sending-emails-via-smtp" target="_blank">code</a> to our production environment configuration.

```ruby
#config/environments/production.rb
ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
  :port           => ENV['MAILGUN_SMTP_PORT'],
  :address        => ENV['MAILGUN_SMTP_SERVER'],
  :user_name      => ENV['MAILGUN_SMTP_LOGIN'],
  :password       => ENV['MAILGUN_SMTP_PASSWORD'],
  :domain         => 'yourapp.heroku.com',
  :authentication => :plain,
}
ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp
```
The configuration variables are automatically set by the addon so we do not need to worry about them. We can then deploy and verify that our emails are being sent correctly.

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Background Jobs</i></h3>
Despite mailgun's good reliability, the problem of loading off responsibilities on third party vendors is that we have no control over their activity which, sometimes may slow down or even <a href="http://blog.mailgun.com/what-happened-yesterday-and-what-we-are-doing-about-it/" target="_blank">break</a>. Since rails can only handle one request at the time this can seriously disrupt the user experience. Thus, it is desirable to move third party activity to background jobs and keep our web server providing feedback to our users.   

In the <a href="https://www.gotealeaf.com" target="_blank">Tealeaf Course</a> we used sidekiq to handle background jobs in our applications. As explain in railscasts' <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/366-sidekiq?view=asciicast" target="_blank">episode 366</a> sidekiq uses Redis to manage it's queue so we need to install it first.

The good people of Redis recommends compiling from source as explained in their official <a href="http://redis.io/topics/quickstart" target="_blank">website</a>, but if you are lazy like me this also works (most of the times) ```sudo apt-get install redis-server```. After that we need to add sidekiq to our project by

```ruby
#Gemfile
gem 'sidekiq'

```
Finally we need to add the sidekiq action mailer extension in the respective controller actions. For example if we want to assign our "welcome to my great app" mail delivery to a background job we can just add the following code:

```ruby
#users_controller.rb
def create
  @user = User.new(set_params)
  if @user.save
    if params[:token]
      setup_user_guest_followings
    end
    #Before: AppMailer.welcome_email(@user).deliver
    AppMailer.delay.welcome_email(@user)
    redirect_to home_path
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```
Now if we are doing TDD (and of course we are) we have to make sure that we are using Sidekiq when running our tests:  

```ruby
#spec_helper.rb
require 'sidekiq/testing'
Sidekiq::Testing.inline!
```

In order to test that everything is working locally we need to start the following processes, each in their own terminal window (protip: set up a tmux session ;)):

<ul>
  <li>Rails server<code>rails s</code></li>
  <li>Redis server<code>redis-server</code></li>
  <li>Sidekiq <code>bundle exec sidekiq</code></li>
</ul>

If you are using the letter_opener gem, you should be able to see the emails sent in your browser.

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Moving everything to Production</i></h3>
Things get interesting when we try to move this set up to our production environment, because we will also need to keep these two processes (Rails server and sidekiq) running concurrently on the heroku server. To achieve this we must specify the type of processes (or dynos) and their corresponding commands in the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile" target="_blank">Procfile</a>: 

```Ruby
web: bundle exec rails server -p $PORT
worker: bundle exec sidekiq
```
Additionally, we need to add the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/redistogo?utm_campaign=search&utm_medium=dashboard&utm_source=addons" target="_blank">Redis To Go</a> heroku add-on. At these point it is important to understand what a Heroku dyno is. According to the Heroku's <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos" target="_blank">guides</a>

<blockquote>
  "A dyno is a lightweight linux container that runs a <strong>single</strong> user-specified command."
</blockquote>

Thus, our current project set up will require at least two dynos running in parallel, which according to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing" target="_blank">heroku's pricing</a> guide will cost us approximately $34.50/month. This is a fair amount considering the quality of service provided by Heroku, but if we are only practicing and toying around we probably want a cheaper approach. 

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Riding Unicorns</i></h3>

Again according to the heroku documentation 

<blockquote>
  "The Unicorn web server lets you run any Rails application concurrently by <strong>running multiple Ruby processes</strong>  in a <strong>single dyno</strong>."
</blockquote>

For us this means that we can use unicorn to run both our web and sidekiq processes without having to use two dynos. It is worth pointing out that this is more like a hack or a side effect. When deploying quality applications we should always consider using the right amount of resources. To get started with unicorn we first need to install the gem 

```Ruby
gem 'unicorn'
```

Then we need to create the unicorn.rb configuration file that can look like this:

```ruby
worker_processes Integer(ENV["WEB_CONCURRENCY"] || 3)
timeout 15
preload_app true

before_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap 'TERM' do
    puts 'Unicorn master intercepting TERM and sending myself QUIT instead'
    Process.kill 'QUIT', Process.pid
  end

  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!

  @sidekiq_pid ||= spawn("bundle exec sidekiq -c 2")
end

after_fork do |server, worker|
  Signal.trap 'TERM' do
    puts 'Unicorn worker intercepting TERM and doing nothing. Wait for master to send QUIT'
  end

  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection

  Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
    config.redis = { :size => 1 }
  end
  Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
    config.redis = { :size => 5 }
  end
end
```

We also need to modify our Procfile declaration to only include the unicorn web server.

```ruby
web: bundle exec unicorn -p $PORT -E $RACK_ENV -c ./config/unicorn.rb
```

Finally since the latest version of Sidekiq removed their built-in support for redis-to-go we need to run the following command from the root of our application:

```python
heroku config:set REDIS_PROVIDER=REDISTOGO_URL
```
That's it. We are now letting mailgun to handle our mail deliveries on the background without paying an extra penny. 

Thanks for reading!
