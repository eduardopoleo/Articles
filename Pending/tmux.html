<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Tmux</i></h3>
<p>By this point when I open my computer my routine was this: open a terminal, naviage to  my root directory and open the editor, repeat this three more times for three more times for the console, database and server.  </p>

<p>Moreover everytime I wanted to switch between some of this windows I had to either click it with the mouse on the lower bar (lame) or toggle using the Alt-tap which is the method i prefer. The problem with this is that is not really obvious which tab is the want you are looking for and many times i found me self going to the full panel of options a few times until if got the window I wanted.</p>

<p>Tmux help you manage this issue by grouping all your terminal windows within a session (which is dispaly as a single window). From within this session you can easily swap to different terminals by pressing some convinietn triggers commands. Also Tmux layout different terminal outputs in the same window. Tmux as vim is also very customizable and also has it own configuration file.  Also and probably most importantly you can automate all this configurations using bash scritps, On my next article I am going to show how to do this. </p>
