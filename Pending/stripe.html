Getting started with stripe is really easy not only because their API is great and intuitive but because they have really good tutorials that guide you step 

First we have to install the gem which we do by 
```ruby
gem 'stripe', :git => 'https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby'
```

Now lets imagine that for our app requires a payment for users to be able to access the content, much like netflix or spotify etc and that we have already set up our user authentication system.

Wrapping API
The firt part is to hande the request by wrapping the methods used to issue the request to the third party.
The second part is to handle the respoonse from the third party vendor.

Also in our code we do not want to have any reference to the original api. We want to wrap all the code in the new wrapper.

question Is there a systematic way of defining the api wrappers. 
What is expect(response).to be_successful ? is it a relish expectation or ir does rspec inferes it from the methods available in the module strip..
What is the difference of putting the :vcr line on context as opposed to put it on specs
Using modules provide namespace we use it so that we can still be consistent with the api naming. 

Testing stubs.
testing stubs. We have already tested the api wrapper throughly so we do not realy want to call it again (it will again call the api).
But we can face the response using stubs.
WE just set the response an object will give us for an specfic method.
So for the test we are going to need a instance of charge, so we stub the api wrapper call so that ir returns a face charga instance.
Then to that charge instance we are going to call other methods we have to sub them as well! 
We only double the charge because we the api call does need an object to be call on.
there are usually two reasons why we use stubs
When the operation is really expensive for operational reasons or because it takes lots of time.
To keep the scope of the test cases.
