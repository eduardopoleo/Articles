<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Carrierwave</i></h3>
Carrierwave allows us to upload images into our application. In order to set it up first we need to install the gem by 

```ruby
#Gemfile
gem "carrierwave" 
```

Then we need to add an attribute of type string to the respective table, in this case the users table.

```ruby
class AddLargeCoverToVideos < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :user, :avatar, :string
  end
end
```
We then run this generator

```ruby
rails generate uploader Avatar
```

which will generate the following file ```app/uploaders/avatar_uploaders.rb``` where we will write:

```ruby
class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
  storage :file
end
```
To indicate that we want to store the uploaded files into the public directory of our application. We then need to mount the uploader so that carrier_wave knows under which attribute must save the image url.

```ruby
#app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
end
```

Finally we need to add the a file field in our form to be able to upload the picture:

```ruby
#users/edit.html.haml
row
  .col-xs-3
    = render "shared/sidebar"
  .col-xs-5.main-column
    = bootstrap_form_for(@user) do |f|
      = f.email_field :email
      = f.text_field :full_name
      = f.password_field :password
      = f.file_field :avatar, class: 'btn btn-file'
      = f.submit "Update Profile!"
```

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Amazon S3</i></h3>
We would normally want to upload our pictures in a place other than our app file directory. We could use amazon S3 server for that purpose. First we need to create an account in the [amazon S3 services ]("http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ "Amazon"), then we can follow this [tutorial](http://blog.danielle.tuckerlabs.com/post/60491757671/creating-a-simple-aws-s3-bucket-with-iam-access "amazon"	) to create a bucket and also to add the correct user privileges.

We can install the [amazon-aws]("https://github.com/sorentwo/carrierwave-aws "amazon gem") and proceed to create a corresponding carrierwave configuration file.

```ruby
#Gemfile
gem carrierwave-aws

#config/initializers/carrier_wave.rb
CarrierWave.configure do |config|
  config.storage    = :aws
  config.aws_bucket = ENV.fetch('S3_BUCKET_NAME')
  config.aws_acl    = :public_read
  config.aws_authenticated_url_expiration = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365

  config.aws_credentials = {
    access_key_id:     ENV.fetch('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    secret_access_key: ENV.fetch('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
  }
end
```

Finally we have to make sure to erase the ```storage :file``` from our uploader since we are not storing the files on the file directory anymore.
