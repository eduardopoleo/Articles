On the last workshop we created a program that keeps track of the score of a bowling game. This was a very interesting problem packed with cool topics like TDD, OO programming and even linked lists! My solution is somewhat inspired from the ["Team Projector" solution](https://github.com/k00ka/bowling-game-kata/tree/david_final "david solution"	) as I was present when we developed it :), but it also has some original insights. My full solution can be found [here](https://github.com/eduardopoleo/bowling-game-kata "solution"). The starting point is shown below: 

```ruby
#lib/bowling_game.rb
class BowlingGame

  def roll(pins_knocked_down)
  end

  def score
  end

private

end
```

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Open Frames</i></h3>
Open frames occur when the player is not able to knock down the 10 pins in 2 rolls. Open frames value or score is determined only by the amount of pins knocked down.  We can start by modeling open frames because they are the easiest case. 

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">1. </span>The game's score is 0 at the beginning of the game</h4>
The smalled code possible to meet this requirement would be:

```ruby
def score
  0
end
```

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">2. </span>The score is 1 for |1| </h4>
 In order the keep track of the scoring we need to create a score attribute and its corresponding getter method, as seen below:

```ruby
class BowlingGame
  def initialize
    @score = 0
  end

  def roll(pins_knocked_down)
    @score = pins_knocked_down
  end

  def score
    @score
  end
end
```

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">3. </span> The score is 10 for |10|</h4>
This test passes without modifying the code.

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">4. </span> The score is 6 for |2,4| </h4>
We need to update the ```@score``` variable so that it adds up the value of every roll that is made:

```ruby
def roll(pins_knocked_down)
  @score += pins_knocked_down
end
```

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">5. </span>The score is 14 for |5,4|5|</h4>
This test also pases without modifications and goes to show that our current code would work for any amount of rolls, as long as, all frames are open frames. Thus, we can start examining the spare frames.

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Spare Frames</i></h3>
Spare frames occur when a player manage to knock down 10 pins after the two rolls of a frame. Bonus points are awarded to spares and their total value can be calculated as follows:

```python
current frame score = 10 + next frame 1st roll
```
The final score will then account for the ```next frame 1st value``` twice as shown in the next test case:   

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">6. </span>The score is 20 for three consecutive rolls of 5.</h4>
Since this is a very simple case where we have a spare at the beginning of the game we can write a rather explicit code like this:

```ruby
class BowlingGame
# ..some code..
  def roll(pins_knocked_down)
    if @score == 10
      @score += pins_knocked_down*2
    else
      @score += pins_knocked_down
    end
  end
end
```
This code complies with this requirements but obviously falls short for most others cases.

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">7. </span>The score is 25 for rolls of |2,3|4,6|5| </h4>
It is painfully obvious now that we need to expand the concept of frame in order to create a more general implementation of the spare. A way to approach this would be creating a frame class that could contain the following behavior:

<ol>
  <li>Stores and retrieves the pins knocked down per each roll.</li>
  <li>Retrieves information from the next frame (Require for spares).</li>
  <li>Knows whether is spare or not.</li>
  <li>Knows if there are still rolls available (Max 2 rolls per frame). </li>
  <li>Calculates its own score considering the different possible scenarios.</li>
</ol>

Following these guidelines we can write the following code:

```ruby
#lib/frame.rb
## Point 1 && 2
class Frame
  def initialize(next_frame)
    @rolls = []
    @next_frame = next_frame
  end

  # getter method for rolls
  def rolls
    @rolls
  end

  # getter method for next frame
  def next_frame
    @next_frame
  end

##Point 3
  def spare?
    regular_points == 10
  end

##Point 4
  def has_more_rolls?
    !(rolls.size == 2)
  end

##Point 5
  def regular_points
    points = rolls.reduce(:+)
    points ? points : 0
  end

  def score
    if spare? && !next_frame.rolls[0].nil? 
      @score = regular_points + next_frame.rolls[0]
    else
      @score = regular_points
    end
  end
end
```
Note how we are already initializing each frame with the frames that follows it: ```next_frame```. The ```next_frame``` is also going to be an instance of ```Frame``` which will set up a nice linked list type of structure. The ```regular_points``` method calculates the points coming from knocking down pins without considering bonus, and returns zero if the frame does not contain rolls yet. Now in the ```BowlingGame``` class we want to be able to: 

<ol>
  <li>Initialize the frames and store them in a orderly fashion.</li>
  <li>Add new rolls to frames.</li>
  <li>Calculate the total number of points coming from all the frames.</li>
</ol>

The code could look like this:
```ruby
require 'frame'
##Point 1
class BowlingGame
  def initialize
    @score = 0
    @frames = []
    9.downto(0) do |n|
      @frames[n] = Frame.new(@frames[n+1]) 
    end
  end

##Point 2
  def roll(pins_knocked_down)
    @frames.each do |frame| 
      if frame.has_more_rolls?
        frame.rolls << pins_knocked_down
        break
      end
    end
  end

##Point 3
  def score
    @frames.each do |frame|
      @score += frame.score
    end
    @score
  end
end
```
We store and initialize the frames within an array because they are ordered and really easy to access. Note how we populate the array backwards (last to first) so that we can initialize a frame with an already existing ```next_frame```. The obvious exception is the 10th frame whose ```next_frame``` will be nil, as it should be. The ```roll``` method  assigns ```pins_knocked_down``` by going through all the frames until it finds one that still has rolls available. Finally the ```score``` method retrieve and adds up all the frames scores.  Since the implementation of spares is rather simple, this code can also handle different cases such as consecutive spares, multiple spares in between open frames, etc. 

At this point we can probably do some refactoring. The first thing we can do is to collapse the  ```@rolls``` and ```@next_frame``` getter methods to ```attr_reader :rolls, :next_frame``` in the frame class. Also, in ```BowlingGame``` we probably do not need to go through all the frames every time we want to insert the ```knocked_down_pins```. We can just keep track of the current frame and check if still has some rolls available, if not we can make use of the ```next_frame``` attribute to move up to the next frame in line. This translates into the following code changes: 

```ruby
class BowlingGame
  def initialize
   #...code... 
    @current_frame = @frames[0] 
  end

  def roll(pins_knocked_down)
    @current_frame = @current_frame.next_frame unless @current_frame.has_more_rolls?
    @current_frame.rolls << pins_knocked_down
  end
#...some code...
end
```

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>Strikes</i></h3>
Strike frames occur when a player knocks down the 10 pins on his first roll of the frame. Their value is calculated with: 
```python
strike frame value = 10 + next roll value + next (next) roll value
```
As we can see the strike score calculation is more complex because it depends on 2 future values. Based on the possible future values we can consider two important cases:

  I) A strike followed by an open or a spare frame
  II) A strike followed by another strike

We can start by analyzing the simplest case when a strike is followed by an open or a spare frame.

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">8. </span> The score is 24 for |10|4,3|</h4>

In order to implement the strikes we need to consider the following points

<ol>
  <li>Redefine the spare frame so that it does not include strikes.</li>
  <li>Create a definition for a strike frame.</li>
  <li>Redefine ```has_more_rolls?``` so that it returns ```false``` as soon as a strike is hit.</li>
  <li>Modify the score method so that it accounts for strikes.</li>
</ol>

Considering these guidelines we get:

```ruby
class Frame
  attr_reader :next_frame, :rolls

  def initialize(next_frame)
    @rolls = []
    @next_frame = next_frame
  end

##Point 1
  def spare?
    if regular_points == 10 && !strike?
      true
    else
      false
    end
  end

## Point 2
  def strike?
    rolls[0] == 10
  end

## Point 3
  def has_more_rolls?
    if rolls.size == 2 || strike? 
      false
    else
      true
    end
  end

##Point 4
  def score
    if spare? && !next_frame.rolls[0].nil? 
      @score = regular_points + next_frame.rolls[0]
    elsif strike? && !next_frame.has_more_rolls?
      @score = regular_points + next_frame.regular_points
    else
      @score = regular_points
    end
  end

  def regular_points
    points = rolls.reduce(:+)
    points ? points : 0
  end
end
```

 The code will also work for cases were we have two strikes that are not consecutive, for instance when rolling 10|4,3|10|2,1. It is important to note that we do not need to touch the ```BowlingGame``` class since we are not changing the dynamics of the game only the nature of the frames.

 <h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">9. </span>The score is 46 for |10|10|4,2|</h4>
 Now lets analyze the case when we have 2 consecutive strikes. According to this [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_%28bowling%29 "strike") we could visualize the result as follows:

Frame 1, roll 1: 10 pins (strike)
Frame 2, roll 1: 10 pins (strike)
Frame 3, roll 1: 4 pins
Frame 3, roll 2: 2 pins

The score from these throws is:

Frame one: 10 + (10 + 4)= 24
Frame two: 10 + (4 + 2) = 16
Frame three: 4 + 2 = 6
TOTAL = 46

So the initial strike frame would have a bonus of 10 points (coming from the next strike) and 4 (coming from roll 1 of frame 3). We need to modify our code in order to account for these extra bonus points.

```ruby
#lib/frame.rb
class Frame
#...code...
  def score
    if spare? && !next_frame.rolls[0].nil? 
      @score = regular_points + next_frame.rolls[0]
    elsif strike? && !next_frame.has_more_rolls?
      if next_frame.strike? && !next_frame.next_frame.has_more_rolls?
        @score = 20 + next_frame.next_frame.rolls[0]
      else
        @score = 10 + next_frame.regular_points
      end
    else
      @score = regular_points
    end
  end
end
```

This code also will work for the case where we have 3 consecutive strikes e.g |10,10,10|. Once more the ```BowlingGame``` class stays the same. The method score is getting ugly we could re-factor it to make it more readable for other developers. We just need to create some private methods with more descriptive names:

```ruby
class Frame
  # ..some code..

  def score
    if spare_scoring_applies? 
      spare_scoring
    elsif strike_scoring_applies? 
      strike_scoring
    else
      @score = regular_points
    end
  end

  private

  def spare_scoring_applies?
    spare? && !next_frame.rolls[0].nil? 
  end

  def strike_scoring_applies?
    strike? && !next_frame.has_more_rolls?
  end

  def spare_scoring
    @score = regular_points + next_frame.rolls[0]
  end

  def strike_scoring
    if next_frame.strike? && !next_frame.next_frame.has_more_rolls?
      @score = 20 + next_frame.next_frame.rolls[0]
    else
      @score = 10 + next_frame.regular_points
    end
  end
end
```
<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>The 10th frame</i></h3>
The 10th frame is different than the regular frames mostly because is the last. This has some implications when calculating both its own and the 9th frame's score. Another important difference is that if the player scores a spare or a strike a third roll is added to the frame. With this considerations we say that the 10th frame should:

<ul>
  <li>Behave like a regular frame if is open.</li>
  <li>Get an extra roll for spares and strikes.</li>
  <li>Manage odd edge cases related with strikes on the 9th frame.</li>
  <li>Calculates its own score just from its face value because there are not next frames.</li>
</ul>


For the 10th frame we are also going to have two main cases to consider:

I) An open or spare 9th frame
II) A strike 9th frame followed by a strike on the 10th


<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">10.</span> The score is 102 for 9x|4,4| and |10,10,10| </h4>
We are going to start by analyzing the simpler case I) of an open 9th frame. The 10th frame is so particular that it probably deserves a class of its own. We can make it inherit from ```Frame``` in order to preserve some common behavior. The 10th frame can then look like this:

```ruby
class TenthFrame < Frame
  attr_reader :rolls
  
 #There is no next_frame attribute in this case 
  def initialize
    @rolls = []
  end

# Note how the definition of strike? changes to accommodate the possibility of multiple strike rolls. 
  def strike?
    if rolls[0] == 10 || rolls[1] == 10 
      true
    else
      false
    end
  end

# has_more_rolls? also changes because there can be more than 2 rolls now.
  def has_more_rolls?
    if !spare? && !strike? && rolls.size == 2 
      false
    elsif rolls.size == 3
      false
    else
      true
    end
  end

# The scoring system is simpler because it does not depend from other frames rolls.
  def score
    points = rolls.reduce(:+)
    points ? points : 0
  end
end
```
On the ```BowlingGame``` class we need to include the 10th frame when we initialize it.   

```ruby
def initialize
  @score = 0
  @frames = []
  @frames[9] = TenthFrame.new

  8.downto(0) do |n|
    @frames[n] = Frame.new(@frames[n+1]) 
  end

  @current_frame = @frames[0] 
end
```
<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">11.</span>The score is 300 for 9x|10| and |10|10|10|  </h4>

We have already defined the behavior of the 10th frame but we also must modify the regular frame ```scoring_method``` so that takes into account the 10th frame. Specifically we want to avoid our program breaking from this nasty edge case:

Frame 9, roll 1: 10 pins (strike)
Frame 10, roll 1: 10 pins (strike)

What will happen is that our 9th frame will recognize that the 10th frame is a strike and will assume that it does not have more available rolls. As a consequence, it will try to fetch the first roll of the 11th frame in order to complete its scoring, and since this frame does not exist our code will break. So we need to modify the ```strike_scoring``` method to account for this: 


```ruby
#lib/frame.rb
def strike_scoring
  if next_frame.class == TenthFrame 
    if next_frame.rolls.size >= 2
      @score = 10 + next_frame.rolls[0,2].reduce(:+)
    else
      @score = regular_points
    end
  elsif next_frame.strike? && next_frame.next_frame.rolls.size >= 1
    @score = 20 + next_frame.next_frame.rolls[0]
  else
    @score = 10 + next_frame.regular_points
  end
end
```

That's it. On my [final solution](https://github.com/eduardopoleo/bowling-game-kata "solution") I re-factored the scoring methods to look a bit more clear and concise but this code as it appears here can effectively keep track of of the score of a real bowling game :). Thanks for reading.
