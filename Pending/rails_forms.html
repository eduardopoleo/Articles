Serving images.
Put images in the assets/images
and the use the image_tag in rails 
= image_tag('dog.png', :class => "img-responsive")
image reponsive makes you image adapt to the display


Testing emails
it 'sends and email to a friend' do
  post :create, invitation: {guest_name: 'Joe', guest_email: 'joe@example.com', invitation_message: 'Hey come and join me at Myflix'}
  expect(ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.last.to).to eq(["joe@example.com"])
end

after do
  ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.clear
end
We use this to clear up emails to be sure that other specs will not break

had this problem
No route matches {:action=>"dashboard", :controller=>"users"} 
What it means is that I am not passing all the necesary arguments to complete the members route 
get :dashboard is not enough and passing the id is required
get :dashboard, id: joe.id


Stripe
An example of stripe payment form
= bootstrap_form_for(@user) do |f|
  %header
    %h2 Sign up!
  %fieldset
    = f.email_field :email
    = f.text_field :full_name
    = f.password_field :password
  %fieldset.credit_card
    %span.payment-errors

      %input.form-control#credit-card-number(type="text" data-stripe = "number")
    .form-group
      %label.control-label(for='security-code') Security Code
      %input.form-control#security-code(type="text" data-stripe = "cvc")
    .form-group

Article about recurrig billing on stripe

Set up:

Install the gem:
```ruby
gem 'stripe', :git => 'https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby'
```
```ruby
#config/initializers/stripe.rb
Rails.configuration.stripe = {
  :secret_key      => ENV['stripe_secret_key']
  :publishable_key => ENV['stripe_publishable_key'],
}

Stripe.api_key = Rails.configuration.stripe[:secret_key]
```
Add the stripe attributes to the rails forms
From there are two ways: set up the payment widget

Or the prefferred one to create a custom form

```python
#views/users/new
= bootstrap_form_for(@user) do |f|
  %header
    %h2 Sign up!
  %fieldset
    = f.email_field :email
    = f.text_field :full_name
    = f.password_field :password
  %fieldset.credit_card
    %span.payment-errors
    .form-group
      %label.control-label(for='credit-card-number') Credit Card Number
      %input.form-control#credit-card-number(type="text" data-stripe = "number")
    .form-group
      %label.control-label(for='security-code') Security Code
      %input.form-control#security-code(type="text" data-stripe = "cvc")
    .form-group
      %label.control-label Expiration
      = select_month(Date.today, {add_month_numbers: true},  class: 'form-control', data: {stripe: "exp-month"})
      %br
      = select_year(Date.today.year, {start_year: Date.today.year, end_year: Date.today.year + 4}, class: 'form-control', data: {stripe: "exp-year"})
  %fieldset.actions.control-group
    .controls
      %input(type="submit" value="Sign Up" class="btn btn-default")
```
We need to set up the necessary java scrip for this

```python
#views/layouts/application.html.haml
!!!
%html
  %head
    %title Firecamp
    = csrf_meta_tags
    = stylesheet_link_tag    'application'
    = javascript_include_tag 'application'
    = yield :head 
  %body
    = yield

#app/views/new.html.haml
= content_for :head do 
  %script{:src => "https://js.stripe.com/v2/", :type => "text/javascript"}
  :javascript
    Stripe.setPublishableKey("#{ENV['PUBLISHABLE_KEY']}");
  = javascript_include_tag 'payment'
```

We create the payment.js file 

```javascript
#app/assets/javascript/payment.js
jQuery(function($) {
  $('#new_user').submit(function(event) {
    var $form = $(this);

    // Disable the submit button to prevent repeated clicks
    $form.find('button').prop('disabled', true);

    Stripe.card.createToken($form, stripeResponseHandler);

    // Prevent the form from submitting with the default action
    return false;
  });
});

function stripeResponseHandler(status, response) {
  var $form = $('#new_user');

  if (response.error) {
    // Show the errors on the form
    $form.find('.payment-errors').text(response.error.message);
    $form.find('button').prop('disabled', false);
  } else {
    // response contains id and card, which contains additional card details
    var token = response.id;
    // Insert the token into the form so it gets submitted to the server
    $form.append($('<input type="hidden" name="stripeToken" />').val(token));
    // and submit
    $form.get(0).submit();
  }
};
```

if we get the following error of the sort ```Asset filtered out and will not be served:``` we just need to the following 

Now becareful with this because if you do that your Js asset might get serve twice and in this case means that your form will be summited twice again.
So make sure that when testing you check your log so that you notice that you are not serving the asset twice

Now finally we can just paste a little stripe snippet into the user create action in order to test that our set up is working correctly.

```ruby
#app/controllers/users_controller.rb
def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)
  if @user.save 
    @amount = 777 

    charge = Stripe::Charge.create(
      :card  => params[:stripeToken],
      :amount      => @amount,
      :description => "Payment for #{@user.email}",
      :currency    => 'usd'
    )

    AppMailer.welcome_notification(@user).deliver
    flash[:success] = 'Welcome to Firecamp! Hope you enjoy the experience'
    @user.update_attribute(:admin, true)
    session[:user_id] = @user.id
    redirect_to dashboard_user_path(@user)
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```

And if our set up is working fine we should be seeing that payment prosecced in our stripe dashboard.

e have to be carefull 
So far until now we've been hitting the wire all the time to test our wrapper but that is undesirable because

Webmock and vcr integration when dealing with external APIs 
Web mock and vrc are used to simulate a response from an external api library. 
We use vrc to record response from external APIs and user stubs and when we want to keep testing at the corresponding level of concern


We just have to install the gems:

gem 'vcr'
gem 'webmock'

```ruby
#spec/spec_helper.rb
require 'vcr'

VCR.configure do |c|
  c.cassette_library_dir = 'spec/cassettes'
  c.hook_into :webmock
  c.configure_rspec_metadata!
end

RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.treat_symbols_as_metadata_keys_with_true_values = true
end
```

Now the first time the test will actully go to the wire and then it will store all the information in a cassette file under the spec/cassettes directory. After thisit will run the spec with the information stored here 

When we finally go to the controller we can use stubs and mocks to test the controller. This will keep the testing interface clean and non repeatable and not polluted with noise that does not belong to the scope. We would have to test againg for different credit card number, cvc that is not relevant in this moment to the controller action since we have already tested the wrapper it self.

As an example in if we want to use we would have to again reproduce the stripe API token generation and include different credit cards number something like this:

```ruby
describe 'Post create' do
  let (:token) do
  Stripe::Token.create(
    :card => {
      :number => card_number,
      :exp_month => 3,
      :exp_year => 2016,
      :cvc => "314"
    },
  ).id
  end

  context 'with valid input and valid credit card info', :vcr do
    let(:card_number) {4242424242424242}

    before{post :create,
           user: Fabricate.attributes_for(:user),
           stripeToken: token} 

    it 'redirects to the dashboard path page' do
      expect(response).to redirect_to dashboard_user_path(User.first)
    end
  end
end
```
Writting this again is unnesessary because we only need to know if the reponse was successful or not. More over this does not really belongs to the create action of the controller scope which real concern is to create or not a user and not really handling payment responses.

We simplify our test to make them look like this:

```ruby
describe 'Post create' do
  context 'with valid input and valid credit card info' do
    before do
      charge = double('charge')
      charge.stub(:successful?).and_return(true)
      StripeWrapper::Charge.stub(:create).and_return(charge)
      post :create, 
        user: Fabricate.attributes_for(:user),
        stripeToken: '345'
    end
           
    it 'redirects to the dashboard path page' do
      expect(response).to redirect_to dashboard_user_path(User.first)
    end

    it 'creates a user' do
      expect(User.count).to eq(1)
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)
  if @user.valid? 
    charge = StripeWrapper::Charge.create(
      amount: 777,
      card: params[:stripeToken]
    )
    if charge.successful? 
      @user.save
      @user.update_attribute(:admin, true)
      AppMailer.welcome_notification(@user).deliver
      flash[:success] = 'Welcome to Firecamp! Hope you enjoy the experience'
      session[:user_id] = @user.id
      redirect_to dashboard_user_path(@user)
    else
      flash[:error] = charge.error_message?
      render :new
    end
  else
    render :new
  end
end
```
This code works as expected but we realized that there are many things that we have to take care about when we create a new user. We have to create a charge, update the admin attribute, send a mail, set the current user in the session, redirect etc. We could just delegate all this to a service object and let the controller to handle just the request response mechanism. Ideally we would want the create accion to have the follwing form:

```ruby
if sign_up.successful?
  flash[:success] = "Some encouraging message"
  redirect_to some_happy_path
else
  flash[:error] = "Some not nice message"
  render :new
end
```

Our user signup service object would look like this:

```ruby
#app/services/user_signup.rb
class UserSignup
  attr_reader :error_message

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def signup(stripe_token)
    if @user.valid? 
      charge = StripeWrapper::Charge.create(
        amount: 777,
        card: stripe_token
      )
      if charge.successful? 
        @status = :success
        @user.save
        @user.update_attribute(:admin, true)
        AppMailer.welcome_notification(@user).deliver
        self
      else
        @status = :failed
        @error_message = charge.error_message
        self
      end
    else
      @status = :failed
      @error_message = "Your user information is not valid. Please check the errors below"
      self
    end
  end

  def successful?
    @status == :success
  end
end
#note that for every possible outcome note that we need to return the instance object itself because we are going to call methods of it later on in the controller. 

#app/controllers/users_controller.rb
def create
  @user = User.new(user_params)
  user_signup = UserSignup.new(@user).signup(params[:stripeToken])

  if user_signup.successful?
    flash[:success] = 'Welcome to Firecamp! Hope you enjoy the experience'
    session[:user_id] = @user.id
    redirect_to dashboard_user_path(@user)
  else
    flash[:error] = user_signup.error_message
    render :new
  end
end
```

The test suite should pass because the stubs still will be valid even if the call to the wrapper is in the new service object. We just have to get used to the new extra layer that we added on top.

We can simplify the controller spects to only test for redirects and flash messages. Also if we did not need to use the @user to redirect to the right path then we could just simple stub the usersignup service objects responses but since we need the creationg the user we need to to through the user_signup, and in this case we just need to again stub the stripewrapper when it goes to the wire

```ruby
describe 'Post create' do
  context 'with valid user signup' do
    before do
      #If we did not need the @user to be created we could have just 
      #stub the methods in the user sign up 
      charge = double('charge', successful?: true)
      StripeWrapper::Charge.stub(:create).and_return(charge)
      post :create, 
        user: Fabricate.attributes_for(:user),
        stripeToken: '345'
    end

    it 'redirects to the dashboard path page' do
      expect(response).to redirect_to dashboard_user_path(User.first)
    end
  end
end
```

Adding subscribtions:
Subscriptions are managed in the stripe wrapper and they are done by creating a stripe costumer object that will cotain the user information (including the card token) and the type of plan that the user is signin for.

Creating a plan:
Create plan using stripes APi 
Creating we do not need to create a charge anymore when creating a plan charges and everything will be manage by stripe directly 

Plans can be set directly in through the stripe api or using their web interphase. Each plan will have a referal number that we are going to associtate with the user when we create a customer

CHARGES:
They are use for a one time payment and they require:
Card token :card
Amount to charge :amount
currency :currency
Description is optional but recommended :description


module StipeWrapper 

class Charge
  attr_reader :status, :response

  def initialize(response, status)
    @response = response
    @status = status
  end

  def self.charge
    begin
      response = Stripe::Charge.create(
        card: token,
        amount: 444,
        current: 'usd'
        description: "Payment for #{user.email}"
      )
      new(reponse, :success)
    rescue Stripe::CardError => e
      new(e, :failed)
    end
  end

  def successfull
    status == :success
  end

  def error_method
    response.message
  end
end

RECURRING BILLING
They use plans and users are stored as customer and then charged they required:
Card token, :card 
Plan :plan
User email (or some metadata to be able to identify the customer later on) :email

the plan should problably be set somewhere in the back end .


def self.create(options = {})
  begin
    response =  Stripe::Customer.create(
      card: params[:stripeToken],
      plan: 'regular'
      email: 'email'
    )
    new(response, status)
  rescue Stripe::CardError => e
    new(e, status)
  end
end

Testing stripe with capybara:

Stripe::InvalidRequestError:
       This customer has no attached payment source
If we run the spec as it is we will get this error, because stripe uses javascript to extract the data from the form. So we need to enable javascript to 
All we need to do is to add , :js => true

expected 0 got 1 user
, now the Selenium driver gives problem with transactional database rollbacks so we need to use another method to clean up the database. For that we need to add the database_cleaner gem to the gemfile and add the following bit of configuration: 


```ruby
config.before(:suite) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
  end

  config.before(:each, :js => true) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.start
  end

  config.after(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean
  end
```

We also need to set the 
config.use_transactional_fixtures = false


VCR::Errors::UnhandledHTTPRequestError:
We also need to add this bit of configuration to the spec helper
to the VCR configuaration
c.ignore_localhost = true

StaleElementReference Error Element not found in the cache
We fix just by adding searching another word

Failure/Error: post1 = Fabricate(:post)
     ActiveRecord::UnknownAttributeError:
            unknown attribute: user
            )
When there is an error like this only on the test enviroment, probably becasue the migration did not update on the test enviroment
db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare 

ActiveRecord_Associations_CollectionProxy:0xdf10484
This is the type of object returned when we use post.comments and is not an array if we want to convert it to an array .to_a 

Eliminating unwanted unvalid objects
@groups = current_user.groups.to_a.delete_if(&:new_record?)


Unreasonable routing error in test
No route matches {:action=>"index", :controller=>"posts"}
Not passing the correct parameters usually missing a param

ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch:
       Group(#83785700) expected, got String(#67630490)
Customers nor payments are not activerecord objects so we need to display them

forgot password

forgot password

Userful one-liners
@post = @group.posts.build(post_params.merge!(user: current_user))

This is an example of what I am talking about

For the user signup SERVICE object we can't use the post

git workflow:

Working on my machine by mysefl:
Try this:
create feature branch 
push brach to the github
merge branch on git hub
switch locally to master on my machine
pull changes

When working with others?


FORGOT PASSWORD:
resources :forgot_passwords, only: [:create]
get 'forgot_password', to: 'forgot_passwords#new'
get 'forgot_password_confirmation', to: 'forgot_passwords#confirm'

resources :password_resets, only: [:show, :create]
get 'expired_token', to: 'password_resets#expired_token'

params for a many to many assotiations
"post"=>{"title"=>"fafasf", "url"=>"fsafasf", "description"=>"fasfasfas", "category_ids"=>["1", "2", "3", ""]}

for M:M there is some querky naming convention Revise that
ok The naming convention is such that
models: post, category, post_category
tables: posts, categories, posts_categories

Confirmation validation is really easy check validation guides

The key to this whole workflow is that we are going to use the random user token to find the user instead of the id as we normally would. We do this because we do nto expose sensible information to the public and also because tokens and disposable we can just discard it and create a new one which is convinient for security. We can't do the same with id obviously. 

for testing that it redirect :back
request.env["HTTP_REFERER"] = "http://fake.host"
expect(response).to redirect_to "http://fake.host"

What is a cart:
A cart is just a list of products that are persited during the user session.
The cart_info must be available at all times while the user is on the app. Store its id on the session

We could create a cart and start adding products.
That is not flexible enough because it does not allow the introduction of number of items 
We need create a new class: cart_item, that includes unit price as the product price and number of times and total 
Problem is that that approach does not allow to add

SErving assests
Hey Brandon,
Thanks I solved the issue by adding:

#production.rb
config.assets.compile = true
config.assets.precompile =  ['*.js', '*.css', '*.css.erb'] 

and running rake assets:precompile
I saw that you do not recommend precompiling the assets locally, why is that? Should we use Capistrano to automate this, is that what the link suggests?
