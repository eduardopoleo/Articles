<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>110-124 About Methods</i></h3>

Methods can usually be used without parenthesis but when we are using other methods as inputs it might be confusing.
When we pass and argument that is not acceptable is an ArgumentError.

We can pass default values to the methods arguments as seen below:

```ruby
def method_with_defaults(a, b=:default_value)
  [a, b]
end

method_with_defaults(1)
#=> [1, :default_value]
```

We can also pass in ```*args``` which means that the method is going to expect an array. We can call the method inside other methods within the same class. A method with an specific receiver would be a method that is call upon an object such as ```34.to_s```. Private methods can also be called inside classes but they can't be have specific receivers. How does this translate in rails? 

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>125</i> About Keyword Arguments</h3>
We set default default values using hashes as seen in the example.
```
def method_with_keyword_arguments(one: 1, two: 'two')
  [one, two]
end
```

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>126- About Constants</i></h3>

Top level constants can be called using ```::```. Nested classes inherit constants from enclosing classes. Subclasses also inherit constants. Although nested class constant beats inherited.

```ruby
class Animal
  LEGS = 4
  def legs_in_animal
    LEGS
  end

  class NestedAnimal
    def legs_in_nested_animal
      LEGS
    end
  end
end

class Reptile < Animal
  def legs_in_reptile
    LEGS
  end
end
```
