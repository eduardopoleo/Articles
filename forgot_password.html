<p>In my previous article I mentioned that I was going to combine tokens and mailers to implement a "Forgot Password?" feature. Before I start I need to make some assumptions about the system we are dealing here: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Our system already contains at least a simple authentication system.</li>
  <li>Our users table contains a <code>:token</code> column.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it let's get on it.</p>

<p>The functionalities required here are going to mainly be managed by two controllers which I am going to name <code>forgot_passwords</code> and <code>passwords_resets</code></p>

<p>The forgot_passwords controller is going to manage the following tasks: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Render a forgot password template where the user can provide his email address if he wants to reset his password (new action).</li>
  <li> Create a reset link and sends the reset email to the user (create action).</li>
  <li> Render a confirmation template informing the user that the email was sent (confirm action).</li >
</ul>

<p>We can start by creating the new template which will contain a simple form:</p>

EDIT: These are the routes involved in the work-flow: 

```ruby
resources :forgot_passwords, only: [:create]
get '/forgot_passwords', to: "forgot_passwords#new", as: 'new_password'
get '/forgot_passwords_confirmation', to: "forgot_passwords#confirmation", as: 'forgot_passwords_confirmation'

resources :password_resets, only: [:show, :create]
get '/expired_token', to: 'password_resets#expired_token'
```

```ruby
#app/views/forgot_passwords.html.haml
%section.forgot_password
  = form_tag forgot_passwords_path do
    %header
      %h1 Forgot Password?
      %p We will send you an email with a link...
      = label_tag :email, "Email Adress"
      = text_field_tag :email,nil
      %input(type="submit" value="Send Email")
```

<p>The only purpose of this form is to collect the forgetful user's email and pass it in to the create action which could look like this:</p>

```ruby
class ForgotPasswordsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = User.where(email: params[:email]).first
    if user
      AppMailer.send_forgot_password(user).deliver
      redirect_to forgot_password_confirmation_path
    else
      flash[:error] = params[:email].blank? ? "Email cannot be blank" : "There is no user with that email in the system"
      redirect_to forgot_password_path
    end
  end
end
```
<small style = "margin-bottom: 15px">We do not really need to define the new and the confirm action because their only purpose is to render templates.</small>

<p>The create action will first find the user with the email provided. If the user exist it will send the email containing the reset link and redirect to the confirmation path. Otherwise, it will set a flash message and redirect back to the forgot password form.</p>

<p>In order to manage all the email we are going to create a subclass from <code>ActionMailer::Base</code>. This class along with it's corresponding view can look like this:</p>

```ruby
#app/mailers/app_mailer.rb
class AppMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  def send_forgot_password(user)
    @user = user
    mail to: user.email, from: "info@myflix.com", subject: "Please reset your password"
  end 
end

#app/views/app_mailer/send_forgot_password.html.haml
%html(lang="en-US")
  %body
    %p Please click on the link below to reset your password.
    %p= link_to "Reset My Password", password_reset_url(@user.token)
```

<p> The <code>password_reset_url()</code> is mapped to the show action of our second controller: <code>password_resets</code>. This controller should accomplish the following tasks: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Render a form where the user can input his new password (show action).</li>
  <li>Effectively reset the user password and users token (create action).</li>
  <li>Render the expired token template if the reset link has been used before or is invalid (expire_token). </li>
</ul>

<p>We can write the show action as follows: </p>

```ruby
#app/controllers/password_resets.rb
class PasswordResetsController < ApplicationController
  def show
   user = User.where(token: params[:id]).first
    if user
      @token = user.token
    else
      redirect_to expired_token_path unless user 
    end
  end
end
```


<p>The show action will receive the user token through the reset link and will assign it to an instance variable. Finally it will render the show template which will contain the form the user can use to reset the password. </p>

```ruby
#app/views/password_resets/show.html.haml
%section.reset_password
  =form_tag password_resets_path do
    %header
      %h1 Reset Your Password
    %fieldset
      = hidden_field_tag :token, @token 
      = label_tag :password, "New Password"
          = text_field_tag :password, nil
    %fieldset.form-group.action
      %input(type="submit" value="Reset Password")
```

<p>Note how we need to create a hidden_field_tag in order to submit the token along with the new password. This is really important because this token is what is going to tell the create action whose password is to be reset, as it is shown below:</p>

```ruby
#app/controllers/passwords_resets_controller.rb
class PasswordResetsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    user = User.where(token: params[:token]).first
    if user
      user.password = params[:password]
      user.token = SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64
      user.save
      flash[:notice] = "Your password has been reset"
      redirect_to signin_path
    else
      redirect_to expired_token_path
    end
  end
end
```

<p>It is important to change the user's token after the password has been reset in order to avoid security issues related with the reset links. This way if someone attempts to reset the password using an old link will be redirected to the expired_token_path.</p>

<p>Uff, well I think that's it. This is probably one of the largest work-flow I've had to learn. Hope you enjoyed the article.</p>
