I finally put together my blog app which consists of a modified Bootstrap  template on top of a Ruby on Rails backend structure. This is not too bad considering that I did not know what a HTML file was 4 months ago. 

Looking back I realize how simple the application is. It could probably get done in a couple of hours by a half-decent developer. But well, one must go through a learning curve before becoming proficient at anything.

I want to list the resources that helped me grasp a better understanding on how the web works.
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.webdesigndegreecenter.org/learn-to-code/">Lear to Code from scratch</a>. I believe this roadmap is a good source of links and material  for anyone looking to get started on web development. It also lays out a reasonable path to gradually build up your skills without getting overwhelmed.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">CodeAcademy. HTML&CSS</a>. I am not a huge fan of code academy, although I think they are a valid starting point if you have no idea whatsoever on the topic at hand. </li>
<li> <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/learn-html-learn-the-foundations-of-html/">Foundations of Html</a>. This is a nice article put together by the people of Udemy that provides a higher view understanding of the most relevant html5 tags. 
<li><a href="http://courses.tutsplus.com/courses/30-days-to-learn-html-css">30 Days to Learn HTML & CSS</a>. This tutorial is priceless and still a free resource! Not only guide you through  the most important aspects of html/css but also gives you a whole bunch of practical advices, like which text editors and browsers to use, how to use the built-in browserâ€™s Dev tools, which plugins to install,  introduces you to css frameworks and psd slicing, it is just great!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-1x-introduction-computer-1841#.U9PCM3VdXeQ">Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</a>. Any decent coding course will do, it will probably do best to take a course in the language you are most interested in. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting started with Rails guide</a>. Here I would recommend to go over the first chapter of the rails tutorial  that teaches you how to set everything up and then jump straight to the getting started guide without keep working on the book. </li>
<li>Have fun when learning. </li>
</ol>
I must note that I did not discover (neither use) these resources in the order presented above,  although if I could go back this is the order I would have chosen. I actually started out with the Edx course and then realized that WebDev was a great and accessible way to put coding to use. 

Essentially the idea is to understand html and css first and then use an integrated framework (such as rails) to help you craft apps and put everything together. On the way you will realize that you need to code a bit ( simple loops, conditionals, etc) so that is why I included the edx course, but this last could be easily replaced by a codeacademy course on the language you are interested in (e.g python if you are interested in learning Django etc). 

So what am I still missing?. The obvious answer is Javascript. I planning to hone my javascript skills with <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">this</a> course. I hope to integrate this with what I already know by creating an interactive to do list and a personal website for a friend. 

Thanks for reading!
