On the last ruby workshop we went through some of the first koans with the purpose to get some insights on the ruby language. This motivated me to start a series about the koans. Throughout this series I'll be making some comments about the things I find most interesting.

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>1-5 About Asserts</i></h3>
```assert``` test if the condition passed-in is true or false. It returns true if the condition is true and error otherwise.```assert``` can be be accompanied by a message to be raised if the condition is not true. 

It is important to note that all the assertions belong to the ```Test::Unit::Assertions``` module so we need to require it in order for it to work, as explained [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3850234/in-ruby-can-you-execute-assert-equal-and-other-asserts-while-in-irb "assert"). The 'opposite' method of assert is ```refute``` which returns false is the condition given is false and an exception if the condition is not false. 

Simple assertions can be tested using these two commands: 

```ruby
#First way
assert expected_value == actual_value

#better ways
assert_equal expected_value, actual_value
```
```assert_equal``` is probably better because it throws a slightly more descriptive default error message. 

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>6-8 About Nil</i></h3>

```nil``` ,like everything in ruby, is an object specifically an instance of the ```NilClass``` which inherits from the ```Object``` class. Nil has some few methods you can call on it such as: ```.nil?```, ```.to_s```, ```.inspect```, ```is_a?```, ```instance_of?```, curiously though:

```ruby
nil.nil? => true
nil.to_s => ""
nil.inspect => "nil"
```
When trying to find out whether an object is nil or not ```obj.nil?``` is better because it uses polymorphisms based on the fact that ```nil``` is the only object for which the ```.nil?``` method is true. Thus, ```nil?``` does not need to perform a comparison between objects which results in a [micro-optimization](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1972266/obj-nil-vs-obj-nil "nil?") over ```obj == nil```.

Extra:```assert_match(regex, expression)``` matches pattern within a string message. 
Extra: The ```[inspect](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Object.html#method-i-inspect "inspect")``` method in general returns a human readable representation of the object.  
<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>8-15 About Objects</i></h3>

Again everything in ruby is an object, everything. 
All objects posses the ```.to_s``` and ```inspect``` methods. This is easily verifiable by calling these methods on the ```BasicObject``` primordial class. 
All object have ids and all ids are instances of ``` FixNum```. All objects posses different ids and small integers ids follow the ```2n+1``` pattern, where n is the number value.

In ruby there is a ```[clone](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Object.html#method-i-clone "Clone")```, method. But clones objects are actually different and posses different ids. As as consequence, you can't clone ```FixNums``` because they would have the same id.

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>16- About Arrays</i></h3>

Arrays belong to the array class and their indexing starts at 0. We can also access arrays elements by using negative numbers, the last element would correspond to the index -1, the element before last -2 and so on. This specially useful when iterating through an array of unknown length. Array elements can also be accessed by providing pair of values (start and length) as shown below:

```ruby
array = [:peanut, :butter, :and, :jelly]

array[0] => [:peanut]
array[0,1] => [:peanut]
array[0,2] => [:peanut, :butter]
array[2,2] => [:and, :jelly]
array[4,0] => []
array[5,0] => nil
```
The last two cases are a bit strange but there is a good explanation in [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3568222/array-slicing-in-ruby-looking-for-explanation-for-illogical-behaviour-taken-fr "Array slicing") SO question. 

Ranges are instances of the ```Range``` class, not to be confused with the ```Array``` class. They respond to the ```.to_s``` and ```.to_a``` in the following manner:

```ruby
range = (1..5)
range.to_s =>  "1..5"
range.to_a =>  [1 ,2 ,3, 4, 5]

```

Ranges can also be non-inclusive meaning that they will not include the last element specified, as an example:

```ruby
range = (1...5)
range.to_a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
Range can be used to access array elements below:

```ruby
array = [1,2,3,4,5]
array(0..2) => [1,2,3]
array(0...2) => [1,2]
```

The ```array.push(value)``` method inserts value at the end of the array. The  ```array.pop``` method pops out the last elements and returns it. 
The ```array.unshift(value)``` inserts a value at the beginning of the array while ```array.unshift``` removes it and returns it.

<h3 style='padding-top:15px;'><i>About Array Assignment</i></h3>
Non-parallel assignment is what we would normally understand as array assignment, while non-parallel assignment sets multiple variables to different elements of an array. As an example:

```ruby
# Parallel assignment 
names = ["John", "Smith"] 
# Non-Parallel assignment 
names = ["John", "Smith"] 
first_name, last_name = ["John", "Smith"] => first_name = "John", last_name = "Smith"
```

Parallel assignment can be used to assign more than two variables. If there is more variables to assign than elements in the array the latter variables are going to be set to nil. Nevertheless the splat operator has a different behavior

```ruby
first_name, *last_name = ["John", "Smith", "III"]
assert_equal "John", first_name
assert_equal ["Smith", "III"], last_name
```
Swapping variables can be much quicker like this: 

```ruby
first_name = "Roy"
last_name = "Rob"
first_name, last_name = last_name, first_name
assert_equal "Rob", first_name
assert_equal "Roy", last_name
```
