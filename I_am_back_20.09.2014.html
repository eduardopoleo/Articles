<p>It's been a while and a lot has happened since my last post. On the last note I mentioned that I was going to start <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">this</a>  self-taught javascript course.  For different reasons I decided not to do it but instead to learn more about backend development and get better at rails.</p>

<p>I also realized that although I had already learned quite a bit by myself, this enterprise was going to be very daunting without any guidance, so I decided to look for some help.  I found many resources out there that help you in different ways at different price ranges. I am listing the most representative ones I stumbled upon while I was searching:

	<li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegrees">Udacity (Nano-degrees)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I finally made my made for Tealeaf Academy because (imo) they offer the best (content depth & quality) to (price ratio). Also the fact that it is an online course made it very convenient for me at this point. The course is basically divided in 3 modules described as follows:
</p>

<table style = "border-radius: 60px; margin:30px auto 30px auto; border-collapse: collapse; padding-right: 10px; font-size: 15px; padding: 50px;">
	<tr style = "background-color:#148780;">
		<td style='height:40; padding: 7px; '>INTRODUCTION TO RUBY AND 
WEB DEVELOPMENT</td>
		<td style= "padding: 0 15px;">4 Weeks</td>
		<td style='padding: 7px;'>$475 US</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style = "background-color:#8AC3C0;">
		<td style='height:40; padding: 7px' >RAPID PROTOTYPING WITH 
RUBY ON RAILS</td>
		<td style= "padding: 0 15px;">4 Weeks</td>
		<td style='padding: 7px;'>$610 US</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style = "background-color:#148780;">
		<td style='height:40; padding: 7px;'>BUILD ROBUST AND PRODUCTION
QUALITY APPLICATIONS</td>
		<td style= "padding: 0 15px;">8 weeks</td>
		<td style='padding: 7px;'>$1485</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Another nice thing about this course is that you do not have to paid the full fee upfront, instead you may decide to go module by module. You can also skip any module you consider unnecessary for you. I have only seen few other courses that offer similar payment flexibility, (maybe Thinkful or Udacity with its upcoming nanodegrees).</p>

<p>As I mentioned before the course is very complete, it goes all the way from ruby basics to advance development techniques in rails such as, TDD, best practices, etc.</p>

<p>I already finished their first course and I enjoyed it a lot. The course helped me getting started in ruby syntax, OOP, and basics of web development. I found it incredibly useful even with the fact that I already had some previous programing experience. </p>

<p>Well that's all I have to say for now, happy coding everyone!
