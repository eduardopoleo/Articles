<p>In the first part of lesson 3 we learned how to develop authentication for our application. I really enjoyed this part because everything we have learned so far (including the first course) came together at this point.</p>

<p>I broke down the authentication development in 8 steps that I think cover more or less the basics as explained in the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!rails">Tealeaf rails course</a>.</p>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">1.</span> Installing bcrypt-ruby gem </h4>

<p>This gem allows us to hash users passwords into an illegible long string of characters. For security reasons this process is "one-sided" meaning that hashed passwords can not be recovered to their original form.</p>

<p>In order to install bcrypt-ruby (or any gem really) we only need to type down the gem's name and its corresponding version on the project's gem file and then run <code>bundle install</code> on the command line.</p>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">2.</span> Add <code>has_secure_password</code></h4>

<p>After adding bcrypt-ruby we need to specify the <code>has_secure_password</code> method in the User model as seen below:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code># File Location: app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  .
  .
  #some code
  .
  .
  has_secure_password validations: false
end</code>
</pre>

<p>This adds methods that allows us to set and authenticate users' inputted passwords against the (hashed) bcrypt passwords stored in the data base.</p>

<p>One useful method provided is <code>.authenticate('password')</code> which verifies that the hashed version of the password submitted by the user when logging in matches the password stored in the database. This method will return the corresponding user object if the authentication succeeds or <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">3.</span> Add password_digest column</h4>

<p>The mechanism explained above requires the presence of a password_digest column of type string in the User. Such column will contains the hashed passwords. We can add this column like this:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code># Command Line: rails g migrations add_password_digest
# File Location: db/migrate/20141012005736_add_password_digest
class AddPasswordDigest < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :users, :password_digest, :string
  end
end</code>
</pre>

<p>By default rails will save the hashed versions of the password  in this column.</p>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">4.</span> CRUD for the User resource</h4>

<p>If we haven't already we should create regular CRUD actions and routes for the User resource. I am going to skip the code here because it is lengthly and it has already been covered in previous posts, but basically we just want to be able to create and update users and have the corresponding views and forms for those actions. </p>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">5.</span> Implement Sessions</h4>

<p>We are going to manage the login and logout features using a 'pseudo' resource called Session. The general idea is to 'create' a session every time a user logs in and then 'destroy' it when the user logs out.</p>
<p>First we need to create the corresponding routes but since sessions are not real resources, (mainly because we do not model or keep track of them at the data base level), we are going to refrain from using <code>resources</code>. Instead we are going to define the following routes:</p>


<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code># File Location: config/routes.rb
PostitTemplate::Application.routes.draw do
  .
  .
  # Some Code
  .
  .

  get '/login', to: 'sessions#new'
  post '/login', to: 'sessions#create'
  get '/logout', to: 'sessions#destroy'
end</code>
</pre>

<p>Then we can also create the corresponding <code>SessionsController</code>:</p>
<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code># File Location: app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    
  end

  def create
    user = User.where(name: params[:name]).first

    if user && user.authenticate(params[:password])
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      flash[:notice] = 'You have successfully logged in.'
      redirect_to root_path
    else
      flash[:error] = 'Your user-name or password do not match.'
      redirect_to login_path  
    end
  end

  def destroy
    session[:user_id] = nil
    flash[:notice] = "You have successfully logged out"
    redirect_to root_path
  end
end</code>
</pre>

<p>The new action will just render the log in form with the username and passwords fields. An example of an adequate rails form can be:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code># File Location: app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
<%= form_tag 'login' do %>
  <%= label_tag :username  %>
  <%= text_field_tag :username  %>
  <%= label_tag :password  %>
  <%= password_field_tag :password  %>
  <%= submit_tag 'Login', class: 'btn btn-success'%>
<% end %></code>
</pre>

<p>Note that we are NOT! using model backed forms in this case because we are not dealing with a 'real' resource in here. As a consequence we have to manually parse the information in the create action.</p> 

<p>The firs thing we do in the create action is to locate the user object with the corresponding <code>params[:username]</code> in the data base and store it in the <code>user</code> variable.</p>

<p>If the query was successful we then proceed to authenticate the <code>params[:password]</code> provided against the info stored in the password_digest column.</p>

<p>If all of the above goes well we then "create" the session by  storing the user primary key in the session hash with <code> session[:user_id] = user.id</code>. As seen in the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum">previous course</a>, the information stored in the session hash is persistent and will not disappear with browser requests.</p>

<p>If the authentication fails we can flash a generic message to the user and redirect to the login_path so that he/she can try again.</p>

<p>Finally the destroy action just sets the <code>session[:user_id]</code> to nil which effectively destroys the session. </p>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">6.</span> Create useful methods.</h4>

<p>Now we need to define some methods in order to verify whether or not at a given time there is an existing session. Note that this is the same as verifying that there is an user_id stored in <code>session[]</code>. Since the users can send request through the UI or using the url bar, these 'checking'  methods must be available in the views, as well as the controllers.</p>

<p>We can now write a code like this in the application controller.</p>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code># File Location: app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception

  helper_method :current_user, :logged_in?

  def current_user
    @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]
  end

  def logged_in?
    !!current_user
  end
 
  def require_user
    if !logged_in?
      flash[:error] = "Must be logged in."
      redirect_to root_path
    end
  end
end</code>
</pre>

<p>The <code>helper_method</code> makes the methods available to the views. The <code>current_user</code> method just queries for the user with the corresponding <code>:user_id</code> and then stores it in the <code>@user</code> instance variable.</p> 

<p><code>logged_in?</code> returns true if there is a current <code>@user</code> and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>require_user</code> flashes an error and redirects if a logged-out user sends a browser requests through the url bar to one of the login controller actions.</p>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">7.</span> Hide and display UI elements.</h4>

<p>With the previously defined helper methods we can now proceed to hide or display elements depending on whether there is a logged in user or not. What exactly should be shown or hid will entirely depend on the application, but the general idea is to wrap the elements within conditional statements like this:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code><xmp><%if logged_in?%>
  <p>Display loggedin text</p>
<%else%>
  <p>Display loggedout text</p>
<%end%></xmp></code>
</pre>

<h4 style='padding-top:15px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">8.</span> Lock controller actions</h4>

<p>Actions can be easily locked using the <code>require_user</code>method defined above. We just need to specify which of the actions we want to lock down for logged out users.</p>

<pre style='margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px;'>
<code>#File location: app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_user, except:[:index, :show]
  .
  .
  # Some Code
  .
  .
end</code>
</pre>

<p>That's it for authentication! Thanks for reading</p>

Misc that are relevant !

1.One can pass in additional values to params in the link_to ex
  <%=link_to "Comments (#{@user.comments.size})", user_path(@user, tab:'comments') %>
  This is to modify behavior when pressing tabs and things like that without using ajax

2.Also params is available both in the controllers and view alike

3.One can pass booleans to partials that can help to display certain parameters
