<p>I have been programming in ruby for few months now. Initially  I just coded some  <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>   problems but now I am using ruby quite often for the <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/">Tealeaf Academy</a> projects.</p> 

<p>I am starting to get confortable with the language but I must admit that I had a few surprises at the beginning. Here I am sharing some:</p>

<h4 style='padding-top:12px; font-weight: bold;'><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">#1.</span> Where are my functions??.. Ah.Methods ... what? </h4>
<p>In Ruby "methods" are used to encapsulate tasks or behaviors, much like functions in other programming languages (Python, Matlab). They are also defined in a similar way.</p>
<pre style='margin-top:12px;'>
<code>def method_name() 
  "Some Code"
end</code>
</pre>
<p>So it is probably just a naming convention that Rubyist adopted for some reason, other than that I do not see any relevant difference in their <strong>FUNCTION</strong>ality compare to functions :).</p>

<h4 style='padding-top:12px; font-weight: bold;'=><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">#2.</span> What's wrong with the good old fashion <code>for</code> statement?</h4>

<p>In order to go through all the elements of an array, hash or string  Rubyist usually use the “each” method.  As shown below:</p>
<pre>
<code>Array.each do |element| 
  if element == "pretty"
    puts element
  end
end</code>
</pre>

<p>This is somewhat convenient because it saves you the time of having to expresively calculate the length of the array, as I have done in numerous ocasions when using other languages.</p>
<p>But what if we just want to repeat an operation a certain number of times. We can still use the each method in combination with ruby ranges e,g <code>(1..3)</code>, no problem. But if we want to count backwards instead, flipping the range <code>(3..1)</code> won't work! One has to use the <code>downto()</code>method to get the work done.</p>
<table style="width:100%; margin:15px 0 15px 0;">
  <tr>
    <th align="center">Counting Forward</th>
    <th align="center">Counting Backwards</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style='padding:0 15px 0 0;'>
<pre>
<code>(1..3).each do |number| 
  p number
end

=> 1 2 3 </code>
</pre>
    </td>
    <td>
<pre>
<code>3.downto(1) do |number| 
  p number
end

=> 3 2 1 </code>
</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Ohh well, I guess counting <code>downto(1)</code> makes more “sense” semantically than “for-ing from 3 to 1”, but it’s a bit counterintuitive if one has some previous programming experience.</p>

<h4 style='padding-top:12px; font-weight: bold;'=><span style = "color:#7D8B31; font-size:18px;">#3.</span> What's wrong with the good old fashion <code>while</code> statement?</h4>
<p>From what I have seen so far the literal <code>while</code> loop is still more used in ruby than its <code>for</code> counterpart, nevertheless it has <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm">many other variations</a>  that I had not seen before. </p>
<p>One of my favorites is the <code>begin</code> loop that allows you to iterate through the loop at least one time before checking if a certain condition is met.</p>

<pre>
<code>begin 
  "some code that will run until condition is met"
end until condition </code>
</pre>

Well those are some of my impressions of ruby as a newcomer to the language. Share yours!
